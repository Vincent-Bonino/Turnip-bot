# Turnips_bot
Discord bot built using python3.

## What is it ?
In Animal Crossing New Horizon, you can buy and sell turnips. What is interesting is that their selling price follows stock market like variations.

This is the fastest way to earn millions of bells, but just like stock market it can be hazardous.

The aim of this bot is to make turnip selling more reliable, trying to forecast the price variations for the week.
It uses models datamined by the community, based on the prices of the previous days.

Obviously, as it is possible to visit your friends' island, it is even more reliable on a Discord server with friends.
